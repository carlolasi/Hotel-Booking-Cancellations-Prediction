Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to predict whether a booking will be canceled using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to identify patterns and factors influencing cancellations, leveraging a Random Forest model for predictive analytics.

Dataset
The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including:

Booking dates
Customer information
Hotel types
Stay duration
Cancellation status
Project Objectives
Clean and preprocess the dataset for effective analysis.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between dates and cancellations.
Build a Random Forest classification model to predict the likelihood of cancellations.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
Key Features of the Analysis
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Removed or handled missing values.
Converted date fields into appropriate formats for analysis.
Engineered features such as stay length and time between booking and stay to capture relevant information.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized patterns in cancellations based on various features, including booking dates and customer segments.
Identified trends in seasonal cancellations and other booking characteristics.
Model Building:

Applied the Random Forest algorithm to predict cancellations based on booking dates and other relevant features.
Tuned hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of the Random Forest model.
Cross-validation was employed to ensure model robustness.
Technologies Used
Python: Data manipulation and machine learning.
Pandas: For data preprocessing and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the Random Forest model.
Results
The Random Forest model achieved strong predictive performance, with significant insights into the factors influencing hotel booking cancellations. These results can be used to improve hotel booking management and reduce cancellation rates.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the utility of machine learning, particularly Random Forest, in predicting hotel booking cancellations. By identifying key trends and booking behaviors, hotels can better manage their reservations and minimize cancellations.
